## How to initialize/run your application (where applicable)

Use the command `python manage.py runserver` to run the application.

## Tests

### How do you run tests?

Use the command `python manage.py test` to run the tests.

### Any tests of note?

Not all of the tests are passing. I can't get the test on the snack_detail path to work. I had a TA come in and look at it, but we were unable to figure it out. I tried to do some searching after that, but I had no success. I'll bring it up to JB in class tomorrow.
